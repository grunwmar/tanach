            "Yah, the Lord of hosts, the living God, King of the Universe, Omnipotent, All-Kind and Merciful, Supreme and Extolled, who is Eternal, Sublime and Most-Holy, ordained (formed) and created the Universe in thirty-two mysterious paths of wisdom by three Sepharim, namely: 1) S'for סְפָר; 2) Sippur סִפּוּר; and 3) Sapher סֵפֶר which are in Him one and the same.",
            "They consist of a decade out of nothing and of twenty-two fundamental letters. He divided the twenty-two consonants into three divisions : 1) three אִמּוֹת mothers, fundamental letters or first elements ; 2) seven double ; and 3) twelve simple consonants. ",
            "The decade out of nothing is analogous to that of the ten fingers (and toes) of the human body, five parallel to five, and in the centre of which is the covenant with the only One, by the word of the tongue and the rite of Abraham. ",
            "Ten are the numbers out of nothing, and not the number nine, ten and not eleven. Comprehend this great wisdom, understand this knowledge, inquire into it and ponder on it, render it evident and lead the Creator back to His throne again. ",
            "The decade out of nothing has the following ten infinitudes : 1) The beginning infinite; 2) The end infinite; 3) The good infinite; 4) The evil infinite; 5) The height infinite; 6) The depth infinite; 7) The East infinite; 8) The West infinite; 9) The North infinite; 10) The South infinite, and the only Lord God, the faithful King, rules over all from His holy habitation for ever and ever. ",
            "The appearance of the ten spheres out of nothing is like a flash of lightning, being without an end, His word is in them, when they go and return ; they run by His order like a whirlwind and humble them- selves before His throne. ",
            "The decade of existence out of nothing has its end linked to its beginning and its beginning linked to its end, just as the flame is wedded to the live coal; because the Lord is one and there is not a second one, and before one what wilt thou count? ",
            "Concerning the number ten of the spheres of existence out of nothing keep thy tongue from speaking and thy mind from pondering on it, and if thy mouth urges thee to speak, and thy heart to think about it, return! as it reads: \"And the living creatures ran and returned,\" (Ezekiel 1, 14) and upon this was the covenant made. ",
            "The following are the ten categories of existence out of nothing : 1) The spirit of the living God, praised and glorified be the name of Him who lives to all eternity. The articulate word of creative power, the spirit and the word are what we call the holy spirit.",
            "2) Air emanated from the spirit by which He formed and established twenty-two consonants, stamina. Three of them, however, are fundamental letters, or mothers, seven double and twelve simple consonants; hence the spirit is the first one. ",
            "3) Primitive water emanated from the air. He formed and established by it Bohu (water, stones) mud and loam, made them like a bed, put them up like a wall, and surrounded them as with a rampart, put coldness upon them and they became dust, as it reads: \"He says to the snow (coldness) be thou earth.\" (Job 37, 6.) ",
            "4) Fire or ether emanated from the water. He established by it the throne of glory, the Seraphim and Ophanim, the holy hving creatures and the angels, and of these three He formed His habitation, as it reads : \"Who made His angels spirits. His ministers a flaming fire.\" (Psalm 104, 4.)",
            "He selected three consonants from the simple ones which are in the hidden secret of three mothers or first elements: א\"מ\"ש air, water and ether or fire. He sealed them with spirit and fastened them to His great name and sealed with it six dimensions. 5) He sealed the height and tnmed towards above, and sealed it with יהו. 6) He sealed the depth, turned towards below and sealed it with היו 7) He sealed the east and turned forward, and sealed it with ויה  8) He sealed the west and turned backward, and sealed it with והי 9) He sealed the south and turned to the right and sealed it with יוה 10) He sealed the north and turned to the left and sealed it with הוי. ",
            "These are the ten spheres of existence out of nothing. From the spirit of the living God emanated air, from the air, water, from the water, fire or ether, from the ether, the height and the depth, the East and West, the North and South.  "

            "The foundations are the twenty-two letters, three 'mothers', seven 'double', and twelve 'single letters'. Three 'mothers', namely Aleph, Mem, Shin, represent Air, Water, and Fire: Aleph mute as Water, Shin hissing as Fire, and Mem as air of a spiritual type, is as balance, standing erect between them and pointing out the equilibrium which exists, speaking.",
            "He hath formed, weighed, transmuted, composed, and created with these twenty-two letters every living being, and every soul yet uncreated.",
            "Twenty-two letters are formed by the voice, impressed on the air, and audibly uttered in five situations: in the throat as guttural sounds; in the palate as palatals; by the tongue as linguals; through the teeth as dentals; and by the lips as labial sounds.",
            "These twenty-two letters, the foundations, He arranged as on a sphere, with two hundred and thirty-one modes. If the sphere be rotated forward, good is implied, if in a retrograde manner evil is intended.",
            "For He indeed showed the mode of combination of the letters, each with each, Aleph with all, and all with Aleph. Thus in combining all together in pairs are produced these two hundred and thirty-one gates of knowledge. And from Nothingness did He make something, and all forms of speech and every created thing, and from the empty void He made the solid earth, and from the non-existent He brought forth Life.",
            "He hewed, as it were, immense columns or colossal pillars, out of the intangible air, and from the empty space. And this is the impress of the whole, twenty-one letters, all from one the Aleph."

            "The three mother [letters] Aleph, Mem, and Shin, their foundation is a pan (of a scale) of culpability and a pan of merit, and the tongue of decree decides between them.",
            "The three mothers - Aleph, Mem, Shin - a mighty mystery, most occult and most marvelous, sealed as with six rings, and from them proceed Fire, Water, [and Air]; these are subsequently differentiated into male and female. Three mothers - Aleph, Mem, Shin, their foundation. And from them were born fathers and all was created from them.",
            "The three mother letters - Aleph, Mem, and Shin -  are air, water, and fire in the world. Heaven is created from Fire [the shin in shamayim]; the Earth from Water [the mem in mayim]; and the Air [the aleph in ’avir] which decides between the fire and the water.",
            "During the year, or in regards to time in general, these three mothers represent Hot, Cold, and Warm. The hot from the fire, the cold from the water, and the warm from the spiritual air, which again is an equalizer between them. These three mothers again represent in the Microcosm human form, male and female; the Head, the Belly, and the Chest. The head from the hot fire, the belly from cold water, and the chest from the warm air that lieth between them.",
            "These three mothers did He create, form, and design, and with the three mothers combine in the world, and in the year, and in Man, both male and female. ",
            "He caused Aleph to reign in the air, and crowned it, and combined one with the other, and with these He sealed the Air in the world, the warmth of the year, and the chest (the lungs) in man; the male with Aleph-Mem-Shin, the female with Aleph-Shin-Mem. ",
            "He caused Mem to predominate in Water, and crowned it, and combined it with others, and formed Earth in the world, cold in the year, and the belly in the soul, male and female, male with Mem-Aleph-Shin and female with Mem-Shin-Aleph.",
            "He caused Shin to reign in Fire and crowned it, and He combined one with the other, and sealed them, as heaven in the universe, as heat in the year, and as the head of Man and Woman. [Male with Shin-Aleph-Mem and female with Shin-Mem-Aleph.]"

            "There were formed seven 'double' letters: Bet [b/v], Gimel [g/j], Dalet [d/dh], Kaph [k/kh], Pe [p/ph], Resh [r/rr], Tav [t/th], each has two voices, either aspirated or softened. These are the foundations of Life, Peace, Riches, Beauty or Reputation, Wisdom, Fruitfulness, and Power. These are double, because their opposites take part in life, opposed to Life is Death; to Peace, War; to Riches, Poverty; to Beauty or Reputation, Deformity or Disrepute; to Wisdom, Ignorance; to Fruitfulness, Sterility; to Power, Slavery.",
            "Seven double letters BG\"D KFR\"T. Seven, and not six; seven and not eight. He tested them and examined them (and drew and contemplated) and placed each on its well  [and the Maker returned to its place?]. ",
            "Seven double letters BG\"D KFR\"T corresponding to seven dimensions: of these, six dimensions - above and below, East and West, North and South, and the Holy Chamber is oriented to the center and it carries them all. ",
            "These seven double letters BG\"D KFR\"THe formed, designed, created, and combined into the Stars of the Universe, the days of the week, the orifices of perception in man; and from them he made seven heavens, and seven planets, and seven Sabbaths; accordingly, the seventh is preferred under all the heavens.  ",
            "He caused and produced Bet, predominant in wisdom, crowned, combined, and formed the Saturn in the Universe, the first day of the week [Heb,: the year?], and the right eye, of man.",

            "Seven doubles - how are they combined? Two \"stones\" produce two houses; three form six; four form twenty-four; five form one hundred and twenty; six form seven hundred and twenty; seven form five thousand and forty; and beyond this their numbers increase so that the mouth can hardly utter them, nor the ear hear the number of them. So now, behold the Stars of our World, the Planets which are Seven; the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. The Seven are also the Seven Days of Creation; and the Seven Gateways of the Soul of Man—the two eyes, the two ears, the mouth and the two nostrils. So with the Seven are formed the seven heavens, the seven earths, and the seven periods of time; and so has He preferred the number Seven above all things under His Heaven."

These symbolize also twelve directions in space: northeast, southeast, the east above, the east below, the northwest, southwest, the west above, the west below, the upper south, the lower south, the upper north, the lower north. These diverge to all eternity, and an as the arms of the universe.",

God produced ה [Hei], predominant in Speech, crowned, combined, and formed Aries in the world, Nisan in the year, and the right hand of man and woman. God produced ו [Vav], predominant in Mind, crowned, combined, and formed Taurus in the world, Iyar in the year, and the left hand of the human.

He fixed these as testimonies of the Triad, the Heptad, and the Dodecad; the twelve constellations rulers of the world, the Dragon Tali which environs the universe, and the microcosm, man. The triad, fire, water, and air; the fire above, the water below, and the air in the midst. The proof of which is that air is a participator with both.",

And our God made the states of opposition, good and evil, good from the good, and evil from the evil. Happiness is reserved for the just, and misery for the wicked ones.",

The dodecad symbolizes war, the triad of amity, the triad of enmity, three which are life-giving, three which are death-dealing, and God, the faithful king, rules over all from the throne of his sanctity. One above three, three above seven, and seven above twelve, and all are linked together, and one with another.",
            "After that our father Abraham had seen, and pondered over, investigated, and understood these things, he designed, engraved, and composed them, and received them into his power (hands). Then the Lord of all appeared unto him, made a covenant with him, and kissed his head, and naming him after his own name, called him his friend; and as it is written, completed a covenant with him and with his seed forever, who then believed on God, the Tetragrammaton, and it was imputed to him for righteousness. God ordained a covenant between the toes of his feet, that of circumcision; and a covenant between the fingers of his hands, that of the Tongue. He bound the essences of the twenty-two letters on his tongue, and God disclosed to him the secrets of them. God has carried these through waters, He has borne them aloft through fire, and He has stamped them in the storms of the air; He has distributed them among the seven stars, and has assigned them to twelve celestial constellations.
